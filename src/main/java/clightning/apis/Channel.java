     * Close the channel with {id} (either peer ID, channel ID, or short channel ID). Force a unilateral close after {unilateraltimeout} seconds (default 48h). If {destination} address is provided, will be used as output address.

     * id: then it applies to the active channel of the direct peer corresponding to the given
     * peer ID. If the given id is a channel ID (64 hex digits as a string, or the short channel
     * ID blockheight:txindex:outindex form), then it applies to that channel.
     * <p>
     * unilateraltimeout: If unilateraltimeout is not zero, the close command will unilaterally close the channel
     * when that number of seconds is reached. If unilateraltimeout is zero, then the close
     * command will wait indefinitely until the peer is online and can negotiate a mutual close.
     * The default is 2 days (172800 seconds).
     * <p>
     * The destination can be of any Bitcoin accepted type, including bech32. If it isnâ€™t specified,
     * the default is a c-lightning wallet address.
